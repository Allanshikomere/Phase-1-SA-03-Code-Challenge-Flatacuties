# Character Voting System

This project is a simple web application that allows users to view a list of characters and vote for their favorite one. The characters are fetched from a local server, the db.json file, and their details are displayed upon selection.

## Features

1. **Character List Display**: Fetches characters from the server and displays them in a list.
2. **Character Details**: Upon clicking on a character's name, the application fetches detailed information about the character, including their image and vote count.
3. **Voting**: Users can vote for a character. The vote count updates dynamically after a successful vote.
4. **Deletion of a charcter** : A user can delete characters from the system via the delete button.
